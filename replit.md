Replaced individual banner sections with consistent, accessible banner component featuring page-specific titles and descriptions.
- **2025-10-31**: Mobile map visibility fixed on institutes page - Removed `hidden lg:block` restriction to enable map display on mobile devices.

Updated institutes page ("내 위치 찾기" button, AI matching button, certification badges, user location marker), GoogleMapView component (trainer markers, user position marker), trainers page (profile backgrounds), courses page (thumbnail backgrounds, BookOpen/Package icons, material badges), and notebook page (title icon, avatars, tab navigation, activity tracking section, upload spinners, video icons, AI helper section).
